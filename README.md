Game Overview:
This level is split into two contrasting sections. 

The Pristine Room

     The pristine room is very orderly where everything is in its place. It has levitating surfaces that guide the player towards a clearly visible and central goal. Completing this room is meant to be effortless and satisfying.

The Jagged Room

     While the pristine room is perfection, the jagged room is broken. The jagged room features slopes and sharp edges that force the player to consider the directions and actions they take. It features a green, leafy exterior with branches sticking out while the terrain creates a designated central pathway. 
     
The goal is to collect all of the coins.

Controls:
